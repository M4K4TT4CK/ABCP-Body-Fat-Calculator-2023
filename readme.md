Subject: Notice of new Army Body Fat Assessment for ABCP

I wrote this about an hour after the Army published the above listed 
ALARACT. There are two versions of the software. One is a standalone terminal app and the other 
is one with a GUI. I plan on adding a third file for exe. 

Whatever it was for fun!
